4. COVID-19 is just like the flu
SARS-CoV-2 definitely has flu like symptoms- aches, fever, and cough. both COVID-19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia. However, COVID-19 is more dangerous with  with a mortality rate between 1% and 3%,10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu

Whoever says COVID-19 is just like the flu obviously doesn't know math.

All of it is @realDonaldTrump's fault for ignoring this.

Seems there are people about who think Covid 19 is just like the Flu.

1) It is far more transmissible.

2) It requires a much lesser viral load in order to infect people.

3) The incidence of becoming seriously ill and requiring hospital treatment is astronomically greater.

"Covid-19 is just like the flu!"
Let's compare.
"the severe flu season of 2017-2018 ... (led to) 
an estimated flu-related 808,129 hospitalizations, "

If Covid hits 4,800,000 hospitalizations that would be a lot worse than the flu.
