# Covid-19 Misinformation and Severity Detection

This is an old project file I uploaded to Github. The data is not included and filepaths are hardcoded.

This uses Zero-Shot Inference via Siamese Networks to group topics automatically and performs a detection of:

​	Stance - For COVID-19 Vaccine or Against

​	Severity - How bad the topic is against the vaccine - Not Severe, Possibly Severe, Severe

​	Rebuttal - If it contains a rebuttal to misinformation or not.
